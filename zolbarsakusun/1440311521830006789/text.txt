Magnitude 6.4 #earthquake off the coast of #Chile 30 minutes ago. Signal on station C1.BI02 (San Fabian de Alico, courtesy of Red Sismologica Nacional and obtained via @IRIS_EPO) clearly not too far from yesterday's 5.1 in the same region. Much stronger signal with more LP energy https://twitter.com/stevenjgibbons/status/1439946696050585602Â â¦pic.twitter.com/PthtMqFp0v
