My people (Croatians from the Dalmatian Highlands/Hercegovina/West Bosnia) were not too long ago known as 'Nigri Latini'.  I therefore identify as Black (Negro) and Latino. 

"1. Black in complexion
2. Moorish in Nationality
3. Of pure Latini origin
4. Aboriginal
5. European."pic.twitter.com/53uBOKKJdO
