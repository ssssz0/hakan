I just recorded this video of a territorial combat between two male Brown Anoles (Anolis sagrei). It involves all kinds of displays: dewlap extension, push-ups, nuchal and dorsal crest erection, tail trashing and curling, tongue protruding, and physical combat/biting! #anolespic.twitter.com/sMbvUCuzE1
